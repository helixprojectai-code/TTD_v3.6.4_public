TTD v3.6.4 — Executive Summary


TTD (Tokenized Trust Data) provides verifiable, cryptographically chained public artifacts for transparency and reproducibility.


What’s new in v3.6.4
- Public transparency via a minimal, audit‑ready pack (Apache‑2.0).
- Supply‑chain hygiene: zero node‑built bundles in prod; single custom JS; tight CSP; SRI pins.
- “Honest mode” positioning: prefer abstention over speculation; clarity + provenance over hype.
- China variant remains separate (SM3/BSN/Gitee), excluded from this drop.


Why it matters
- Verifiable artifacts (hashes + signatures) reduce ambiguity, enable reproducibility, and establish authenticity amid bot‑heavy, synthetic‑tone traffic.
- Minimal runtime surface area lowers phishing/dependency hijack risk and simplifies audits.


How to engage
- Check hashes, verify the detached signature, and review the ASCII chain map and verification steps in TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.txt.
- File list and token header templates included; press materials are prepared but ON HOLD pending timing.
