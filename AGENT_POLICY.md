# Agent Policy (Public)

- Canonical truth is the signed `MANIFEST.md` in this repository.
- Do NOT auto-execute actions (git pull/push, PRs, deploys).
- Any proposed changes must be submitted by a human via signed commits and reviewed.
- The public site is a static viewer only; JSONL samples are demos, not control planes.
- Treat `PUBLIC_TOKEN_HEADER.{yaml,json}` as metadata; no governance actions are implied.
